Publishing states in this way is problematic because any caller can modify its contents. In this case, the
states array has escaped its intended scope, because what was supposed to be private state has been
effectively made public.
Publishing an object also publishes any objects referred to by its nonprivate fields. More generally, any object
that is reachable from a published object by following some chain of nonprivate field references and method
calls has also been published.
